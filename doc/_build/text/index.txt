Overview

Easily batch-build cmake projects!

cmany is a command line tool to easily build variations of a CMake
C/C++ project.  It combines different compilers, cmake build types,
compilation flags, processor architectures (WIP) and operating systems
(also WIP).

For example, to configure and build a project combining clang++ and
g++ with both Debug and Release:

   $ cmany build -c clang++,g++ -t Debug,Release path/to/CMakeLists.txt

The command above will result in four different build trees, placed by
default under a "build" directory placed in the current working
directory:

   $ ls build/*
   build/linux-x86_64-clang++3.9-Debug
   build/linux-x86_64-clang++3.9-Release
   build/linux-x86_64-gcc++6.1-Debug
   build/linux-x86_64-gcc++6.1-Release

Each build tree is obtained by first configuring CMake with the given
parameters, and then invoking "cmake --build" to build the project at
once.

You can also use cmany just to simplify your cmake workflow! These two
command sequences have the same effect:

+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| typical cmake                   | cmany                           |
+=================================+=================================+
| "$ mkdir build" "$ cd build" "$ | "$ cmany b"                     |
| cmake .." "$ cmake --build ."   |                                 |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+


Features
========

* Easily configure and build many variations of your project with
  one simple command.

* Saves the tedious work of dealing with many build trees by hand.

* Sensible defaults: "cmany build" will create and build a single
  project using CMake's defaults.

* Transparently pass flags (compiler flags, processor defines or
  cmake cache variables) to any or all of the builds.

* Useful for build comparison and benchmarking. You can easily setup
  bundles of flags, aka variants.

* Useful for validating and unit-testing your project with different
  compilers and flags.

* Useful for creating distributions of your project.

* Avoids a full rebuild when the build type is changed. Although
  this feature already exists in multi-configuration cmake generators
  like Visual Studio, it is missing from mono-configuration generators
  like Unix Makefiles.

* Run arbitrary commands in every build tree or install tree.

* Emacs integration! https://github.com/biojppm/cmany.el
