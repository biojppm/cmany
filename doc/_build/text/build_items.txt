Build items
***********

(You can read this document with the command "cmany help
build_items").

cmany creates its builds by combining build items. There are the
following classes of build items:

* systems: "-s/--systems sys1[,sys2[,...]]"

* architectures: "-a/--architectures arch1[,arch2[,...]]"

* compilers: "-c/--compilers comp1[,comp2[,...]]"

* build types: "-t/--build-types btype1[,btype2[,...]]"

* variants: "-v/--variants var1[,var2[,...]]"

All of the arguments above accept a comma-separated list of items (but
note that no spaces should appear around the commmas). Repeated
invokation of an argument has the same effect. For example, "-c
g++,clang++" is the same as "-c g++ -c clang++".

Any omitted argument will default to a list of a single item based on
the current system (for example, omitting "-s" in linux yields an
implicit "-s linux" whereas in windows yields an implicit "-s
windows"; or omitting "-a" in a 64 bit processor system yields an
implicit "-a x86_64").

cmany will generate builds by combining every build item with every
other build item of different class. The resulting builds have a name
of the form
"{system}-{architecture}-{compiler}-{build_type}[-{variant}]".

Since the number of combinations grows very quickly and not every
combination will make sense, cmany has arguments to exclude certain
combinations, either by the resulting build name (with a regex) or by
the names of the items that a build would be composed of. Read more
about it here.

The following sections address each of these build items in more
detail.


Per-item flags
==============

To make a build item bring with it a set of properties (which can be
compiler flags, macros, cmake flags, or combination exclusion
arguments), use the following syntax: "'item_name: <flag_specs>....'"
instead of just "item_name". This will prompt cmany to use those flags
whenever that build item is used in a build. For example, you can add
a flag only to a certain build type:

   $ cmany b --build-types Release,'Debug: --cxxflags "-Wall"'

Note the use of the quotes; this is necessary to have the arguments
correctly parsed:

* The outer quotes (single quotes in this case) are necessary for
  causing the full specification of the "Debug" build type to be
  considered at once.

* The inner quotes around the "-Wall" flag in the "Debug"
  configuration are needed to prevent it from being parsed as an
  argument to cmany, which would cause an error.

* The order of the quotes is irrelevant to cmany. The Debug
  configuration could also have been specified as ""Debug: --cxxflags
  '-Wall'"".

* You can also escape the quotes using the backslash character. For
  example, you can do ""Debug: --cxxflags \"-Wall\""" or "'Debug:
  --cxxflags \'-Wall\''".

See the cmany help on flags to discover what flags can be used with
build items. Note also that exclusion flags can also be used as per-
item flags.

When creating the flags for the build, the order in the final compile
command is the following:

1. command-level flags

2. system flags

3. architecture flags

4. compiler flags

5. build type flags

6. variant flags

So command level flags come first and variant flags come last in the
compiler command line. Note that flags from later build items override
those of earlier build items. For example, variant flags override
flags from the build type; these in turn override flags specified with
the compiler, and so on.


Inheriting per-item flags
-------------------------

To make a build item inherit all the flags in another build item,
reference the base item name prefixed with "@". The result is that the
inheriting item will have all the flags of the base item, plus its own
flags inserted at the point where the "@" reference occurs.
combination flags are **not** inherited.

For example, note the "@foo" spec in the bar variant:

   $ cmany b -v none \
             -v 'foo: --defines SOME_DEFINE=32 --cxxflags "-Os"' \
             -v 'bar: @foo --defines SOME_DEFINE=16 -cxxflags "-O2"'

With this command, bar will be now consist of "-D
SOME_DEFINE=32,SOME_DEFINE=16 -X "-Os","-O2"'".

Note: Order matters here: the place where the inheritance directive
  occurs is relevant. For example:

     $ cmany b -v none \
              -v 'foo: --defines SOME_DEFINE=32 --cxxflags "-Os"' \
              -v 'bar: --defines SOME_DEFINE=16 -cxxflags "-O2" @foo'

  will make bar consist instead of "-D SOME_DEFINE=16,SOME_DEFINE=32
  -X "-O2","-Os"". So here "SOME_DEFINE" will have with a value of 16,
  as opposed to 32 which will be the value in the previous example.
  This happens because cmany will insert foo's options right in the
  place where "@foo" appears.


Compilers
=========

cmany defaults to CMake's default compiler. To use different
compilers, use "--compilers/-c". Each argument given here must be an
executable compiler found in your path, or an absolute path to the
compiler.

The following command chooses clang++ instead of CMake's default
compiler:

   $ cmany b -c clang++

If the directory is initially empty, this will be the result:

   $ ls -1 build/*
   build/linux-x86_64-clang++3.9-Release/

Note that cmany will query the compiler for a name and a version. This
is for ensuring the use of different build trees for different
versions of the same compiler. The logic for extracting the compiler
name/version may fail in some cases, so open an issue if you see
problems here.


Microsoft Visual Studio
-----------------------

Picking the Visual Studio version with CMake is harder than it should
be. cmany tries to make this easier to do. For example, this will use
Visual Studio 2015 **in the native architecture**:

   $ cmany b -c vs2015
   $ ls -1 build/*
   build/windows-x86_64-vs2015-Release/

as opposed to the option required by CMake, which would be "-G "Visual
Studio 15 2017 Win64""). So if cmany is running in a 32 bit system,
then the result of running the command above will be a 32 bit build
instead:

   $ cmany b -c vs2015
   $ ls -1 build/*
   build/windows-x86-vs2015-Release/

An explicit request for the target architecture may be made by
appending a "_32" or "_64" suffix. For example, if Visual Studio 2017
in 32 bit mode is desired, then simply use "vs2017_32":

   $ cmany b -c vs2017_32
   $ ls -1 build/*
   build/windows-x86-vs2017-Release/

You can also choose the VS toolset to use in the compiler name. For
example, compile with the "clang" frontend (equivalent in this case to
cmake's "-T v141_clang_c2" option):

   $ cmany b -c vs2017_clang
   $ ls -1 build/*
   build/windows-x86-vs2017_clang-Release/

cmany allows you to create any valid combination of the Visual Studio
project versions (from vs2017 to vs2005), target architectures (32,
64, arm, ia64) and toolsets (from v141 to v80, with clang_c2 and xp
variants). The general form for the cmany VS specification alias is:

   <vs_project_version>[_<vs_platform_version>][_<vs_toolset_version>]

Note that the order must be exactly as given. Note also that the
platform version or the toolset version can be omitted, in which case
a sensible default will be used:

   * if the platform is omitted, then the current platform will be
     used

   * if the toolset is omitted, then the toolset of the given
     project version will be used.

Given the many VS versions, target architectures and toolsets, this
creates hundreds of possible aliases, so read the complete
documentation for Visual Studio.


Build types
===========

cmany uses "Release" as the default build type. To set a different
build type use "--build-types/-t". The following command chooses a
build type of Debug instead of Release:

   $ cmany b -t Debug

If the directory is initially empty, this will be the result:

   $ ls -1 build/*
   build/linux-x86_64-g++6.1-Debug/

Note that the build naming scheme will cause build trees with
different build types to be placed in different directories. Apart
from producing a better organization of your builds, this saves you a
full project rebuild when the build type changes (and the cmake
generator is not a multi-config generator like MSVC).


Variants
========

cmany has **variants** for setting up a bundle of flags to be combined
with all other build items.

A variant is a build item different from any other which uses a
specific combination of flags via "--cmake-vars/-V", "--defines/-D", "
--cxxflags/-X", "--cflags/-C". Like all other build items, it will be
combined with other build items of different class. With the exception
of the null variant, variants will usually have per-item flags.

The command option to setup a variant is "--variant/-v" and should be
used as follows: "--variant 'variant_name: <variant_specs>'". For
example, assume a vanilla build:

   $ cmany b

which will produce the following tree:

   $ ls -1 build
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Release/

If instead of this we want to produce two variants "foo" and "bar"
with specific defines and compiler flags, the following command should
be used:

   $ cmany b --variant 'foo: --defines SOME_DEFINE=32 --cxxflags "-Os"' \
             --variant 'bar: --defines SOME_DEFINE=16 --cxxflags "-O2"'

or, in short form:

   $ cmany b -v 'foo: -D SOME_DEFINE=32 -X "-Os"' \
             -v 'bar: -D SOME_DEFINE=16 -X "-O2"'

To be clear, the "foo" variant will be compiled with the preprocessor
symbol named "SOME_DEFINE" defined to 32, and will use the "-Os" C++
compiler flag. In turn, the "bar" variant will be compiled with the
preprocessor symbol named "SOME_DEFINE" defined to 16, and will use
the "-O2" C++ compiler flag. So instead of the build above, we now
get:

   $ ls -1 build
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Release-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Release-foo/

Variants will be combined, just like compilers or build types. So
applying the former two variants to the 9-build example above will
result in 18 builds (3 compilers * 3 build types * 2 variants)

   $ cmany b -c clang++,g++,icpc -t Debug,Release,MinSizeRel \
             --variant 'foo: -D SOME_DEFINE=32 -X "-Os"' \
             --variant 'bar: -D SOME_DEFINE=16 -X "-O2"'
   $ ls -1 build/
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Debug-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Debug-foo/
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-MinSizeRel-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-MinSizeRel-foo/
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Release-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Release-foo/
   build/linux-x86_64-gcc6.1-Debug-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-gcc6.1-Debug-foo/
   build/linux-x86_64-gcc6.1-MinSizeRel-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-gcc6.1-MinSizeRel-foo/
   build/linux-x86_64-gcc6.1-Release-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-gcc6.1-Release-foo/
   build/linux-x86_64-icc16.1-Debug-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-icc16.1-Debug-foo/
   build/linux-x86_64-icc16.1-MinSizeRel-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-icc16.1-MinSizeRel-foo/
   build/linux-x86_64-icc16.1-Release-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-icc16.1-Release-foo/

Note that like any other build item "--variant/-v" also accepts comma-
separated arguments:

   $ cmany b -c clang++,g++,icpc -t Debug,Release,MinSizeRel \
             --variant 'foo: -D SOME_DEFINE=32 -X "-Os"','bar: -D SOME_DEFINE=16 -X "-O2"'


Null variant
------------

cmany will combine only the variants it is given. Notice above that
the basic (variant-less) build "linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Debug" is not
there.  To retain the basic build without a variant suffix use the
special name "none":

   $ cmany b -v none \
             -v 'foo: -D SOME_DEFINE=32 -X "-Os"' \
             -v 'bar: -D SOME_DEFINE=16 -X "-O2"'
   $ ls -1 build
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Release/
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Release-bar/
   build/linux-x86_64-clang3.9-Release-foo/

You can add flags to the "none" variant as well, and use inheritance
at will:

   $ cmany b -v 'none: -X "-Wall"' \
             -v 'foo: @none -D SOME_DEFINE=32 -X "-Os"' \
             -v 'bar: @none -D SOME_DEFINE=16 -X "-O2"'


Systems
=======

The argument to specify system build items is "-s/--systems". Systems
are a special build item. For example, if you are on linux, omitting
"-s" will default to "-s linux", so using "-s" it is not really
needed. But compiling for a different target system qualifies as cross
compilation and requires a cmake toolchain file (for which cmany
offers the "-T/--toolchain" flag).

Usually, a toolchain also fixes the compiler and maybe the processor
architecture. So most of the time, whenever "-s/--systems" is used, it
will bring with it a toolchain and will also require exclusion
arguments to prevent combination of the target system with compilers
or architectures different from those of the toolchain.

For example, consider this linux ARM gnueabihf cmake toolchain:

   # arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake

   set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
   set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 1)

   set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++)
   set(CMAKE_STRIP        /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-strip)

   set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf)

   set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
   set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
   set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)

(If you are using Ubuntu you can install these tools with "sudo apt-
get install binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf").
When you want to compile your project only for linux OS and
(armv5,armv7) architectures, this would be the command line:

   $ cmany b --systems 'linux: -T arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake' \
             --architectures 'armv5: -X "-march=armv5"' \
             --architectures 'armv7: -X "-march=armv7"'

which will produce the following builds:

   linux-armv5-arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++5.4-Release
   linux-armv7-arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++5.4-Release

If you want to build at the same time for x86 and x86_64, this command
could be used (note the use of "--exclude-builds"):

   $ cmany b --systems linux \
             --architectures x86,x86_64 \
             --systems 'linux_arm: -T arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake -xa x86,x86_64' \
             --architectures 'armv5: -X "-march=armv5"' \
             --architectures 'armv7: -X "-march=armv7"' \
             --exclude-builds 'linux_arm-.*x86','linux-.*arm'

which produces the following builds:

   linux-x86-g++5.4-Release
   linux-x86_64-g++5.4-Release
   linux_arm-armv5-arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++5.4-Release
   linux_arm-armv7-arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++5.4-Release

The arm builds for linux now use a system named linux_arm to prevent
ambiguity with the native "linux" system. The "--exclude-builds" is
used to prevent the arm toolchain from being combined with x86 or
x86_64 architectures and also to prevent the arm architectures from
being used without a toolchain.


Architectures
=============

Architectures are specified with the argument "-a/--architectures".
When the architecture argument is omitted, cmany will silently default
to "-a <current_architecture>".

Like with "-s/--systems", architectures have some special properties:

* When in a 64 bit system, asking for a "x86" architecture when the
  compiler is a gcc-like compiler (ie, gcc, clang, icc, zapcc or
  similar) will result in the the compiler flag "-m32" being added to
  "CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS" and "CMAKE_C_FLAGS".

* Conversely, when in a 32 bit system, asking for a "x86_64"
  architecture with a gcc-like compiler will result in the flag "-m64"
  being added to "CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS" and "CMAKE_C_FLAGS".

* When using Visual Studio, you can select the compiler and
  architecture at once. For example, using "-c vs2015_32,vs2015_64"
  will compile both for "x86" and "x86_64", and is equivalent to "-c
  vs2015 -a x86,x86_64".

Architectures other than x86/x86_64, as with "-s/--systems",
"-a/--architectures" will usually need cross-compilation and thus
require toolchains. In fact the, command used in the example of the
Systems section can be simplified if the toolchain is specified by
architecture instead of the system, and the variants instead provide
the "-m" compiler flags:

   $ cmany b --architectures x86,x86_64,'arm: -T arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake' \
             --variants 'none: -xa arm' \
             --variants 'armv5: -X "-march=armv5" -ia arm' \
             --variants 'armv7: -X "-march=armv7" -ia arm'

The "-xa" and the "-ia" arguments above are the short forms of
respectively the exclusion arguments "--exclude-architectures" and "--
include-architectures". They are needed to prevent combination of the
arm variants with the x86 architectures and vice-versa. The resulting
builds are exactly the same as in that example, but are now named
differently because of the variants:

   linux-x86-g++5.4-Release
   linux-x86_64-g++5.4-Release
   linux-arm-arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++5.4-Release-armv5
   linux-arm-arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++5.4-Release-armv7
