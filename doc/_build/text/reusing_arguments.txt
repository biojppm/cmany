Reusing arguments
*****************

In certain scenarios, the arguments to a "cmany" command can get a bit
complicated. To aid in such scenarios, "cmany" offers two ways of
storing these arguments, so that they are implicitly used in simple
commands such as "cmany build".


Session arguments
=================

You can store arguments in the environment variable "CMANY_ARGS". Then
the resulting cmany command is taken as if it were given "cmany
<subcommand> $CMANY_ARGS <command line arguments>". In the example
below, the configure, build and install commands will all use the five
given compilers and two build types, resulting in 10 build trees:

   $ export CMANY_ARGS="-c clang++-3.9,clang++-3.8,g++-6,g++-7,icpc \
                        -t Debug,Release"
   $ cmany c   # 10 builds
   $ cmany b   # same
   $ cmany i   # same

The arguments stored in "CMANY_ARGS" can be combined with any other
argument. For example, if you now want to build only the "Debug" types
of the current value of "CMANY_ARGS", just use the "--include-
types/--it" inclusion flag:

   $ cmany b -it Debug

or as another example, you can process only a single build tree via
the "--include-builds/-ib", say, "icpc" with "Release":

   $ cmany b -ib 'icpc.*Release'

Some arguments to cmany are meant to be used before the cmany
subcommand. For those arguments, you should use the "CMANY_PFX_ARGS"
environment variable instead of "CMANY_ARGS". cmany will see commands
given to it as "cmany $CMANY_PFX_ARGS <subcommand> $CMANY_ARGS
<command line arguments>".

Note: The values of the "CMANY_ARGS" and "CMANY_PFX_ARGS"
  environment variables are always used in every "cmany" invokation.
  To prevent cmany from using these values, you will have to unset the
  variables:

     $ unset CMANY_ARGS CMANY_PFX_ARGS
     $ cmany b   # uses defaults now


Project file
============

"cmany" also allows you to permanently store its arguments in a
"cmany.yml" file which should be placed alongside the project
"CMakeLists.txt". This feature is under current development and is not
ready.
